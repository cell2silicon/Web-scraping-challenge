# Web-scraping-challenge
<br/> 1. I started to scrape this with jupyter first.
<br/> 2. Once I had it working in the jupyter, I took that code to scraper.py.
<br/> 3. Made engine connection and using beautiful soup I connected it to url.
<br/> 4. Once URL was connected I made flask app.
<br/> 5. After making sure that the flask app is working and scraping the data, I wrote HTML code.
<br/> 6. Made sure that HTML has the positioning and the sections set in right place. 
<br/> 7. Added CSS to HTML. 
<br/> 8. As a final test, clicked the button on HTML page to make sure everything is connected and working smothly.
